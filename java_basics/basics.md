# BASICS

## Overview

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is at the core of Java. In fact, all Java
programs are to at least some extent object-oriented. There are two elements of programming: code and data.Furthermore, a
program can be conceptually organized around its code or around its data.

To manage increasing complexity of precedural programming, object-oriented programming has been invented.Object-oriented programming organizes
a program around its data (that is, objects) and a set of well-defined interfaces
to that data. One of the main advantages of OOP are 

1. Abstraction
1. Encapsulation
    * public and private.

1. Inheritance
1. Polymorphism

## Basic program structure of Java

The first thing
that you must learn about Java is that the name you give to a source file is very
important. The name of the main class must be the same as the name of the file.

### Compiling the program

To compile the Example program, execute the compiler, javac, specifying the
name of the source file on the command line.

The javac compiler creates a file called Example.class that contains the
bytecode version of the program

> C:\>javac Example.java

To actually run the program, you must use the Java application launcher
called java.

> C:\>java Example
