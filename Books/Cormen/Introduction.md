# Introduction

An algorithm can have many factors that decide the efficacy for a use case.

For example, for a sorting algorithm, the factors can be like

1. How sorted the list already is. ( Bubble might not work as effectively for an already almost sorted list but Insertion sort might)
2. Possible restrictions on the item values. 
3. The architecture of the computer. 
4. The storage devices used. ( If the storage is known to be slow, we might prefer an algorithm involving the least amount of read/writes over computation)
